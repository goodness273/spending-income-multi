# Multi-Transaction Review Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the multi-transaction review feature, which allows users to review, edit, and save multiple transactions detected by AI.

## Components

### 1. MultiTransactionStandalone
We've created a standalone component that handles the display and editing of multiple transactions. This component:
- Displays a list of transactions with category icons (using outlined icons)
- Allows editing individual transactions through a modal form
- Supports deleting transactions with confirmation
- Provides navigation back to the main interface

### 2. Integration Strategy
Instead of immediately modifying the complex `AddTransactionModal`, we'll integrate our standalone component as follows:

1. **Modal View Type**:
   - Add `aiMultiReview` to the `ModalView` enum in `transaction_models.dart`

2. **Integration Point**:
   - When transactions are detected by AI, display the `MultiTransactionStandalone` component
   - Include navigation controls to move between the AI chat and the transaction review

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - We've created a test component accessible from the Profile screen
   - This allows testing the feature independently before full integration

## Implementation Steps

1. **Complete and Test Standalone Component**:
   - Fix any styling issues to ensure consistency with the app's design language
   - Ensure all outlined icons are used for categories
   - Verify all functionality works properly

2. **Integrate with Main App**:
   - Once standalone testing is complete, integrate into the main transaction flow
   - Ensure proper navigation between components
   - Implement data persistence (saving transactions to the database)

3. **Final Testing**:
   - Test the full workflow from AI detection to transaction saving
   - Verify multi-transaction editing and deleting
   - Ensure UI consistency throughout the flow

## Design Principles

1. **User Interface**:
   - Follow the app's existing design patterns
   - Use outlined icons for all category displays
   - Maintain consistent color schemes for transaction types

2. **User Experience**:
   - Provide clear navigation between views
   - Implement confirmation for destructive actions
   - Ensure feedback when transactions are saved

## Next Steps

The implementation of `MultiTransactionStandalone` is complete, but integration with the main app requires:

1. Fixing the compile-time errors in `AddTransactionModal`
2. Implementing the AI detection flow that generates multiple transactions
3. Creating the appropriate connection points to the transaction database

Once these steps are completed, the multi-transaction review feature will be fully functional.
